<!-- Button trigger modal -->
<button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-light" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#add_track">
    UPLOAD
</button>

<!--I Used Add Track Modal at the bottom of user_nav.blade.php because there are issues if i put it here
    because in the documentation of modal the say " Nested modals aren’t supported as we believe them to be poor user experiences."
