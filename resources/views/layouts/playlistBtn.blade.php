<!-- Button trigger modal -->
<button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-light" data-toggle="modal" id="playlist-user_nav-btn" data-target="#playlist">
    PLAYLIST
</button>

<!--I Used PLAYLIST Modal at the bottom of user_nav.blade.php because there are issues if i put it here
    because in the documentation of modal the say " Nested modals arenâ€™t supported as we believe them to be poor user experiences."
