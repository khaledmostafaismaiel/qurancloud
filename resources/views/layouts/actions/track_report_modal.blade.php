<!-- Button trigger modal -->
<button type="button" class="btn btn-warning w-100" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#track-report-{{$track->id}}">
    Report
</button>
<!--I Used Track Report Modal at the bottom of track.blade.php because there are issues if i put it here
    because in the documentation of modal the say " Nested modals arenâ€™t supported as we believe them to be poor user experiences."
